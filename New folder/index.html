                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document

            <div class="content">
                <img src="./images/1_FifZUGz97Onmb7RUOairbg.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;padding: 10px;">
                <h6>CSS Box Model</h6>
                <p>
                    The box model has been around the longest and remains a viable approach to layout design. It relies
                    on
                    margins, borders, and padding to define the spacial relationships between UI elements. Using things
                    like
                    float and clear, these "boxes" of content can be aligned both vertically and horizontally on the
                    page.
                </p>
                <h6>Advantages</h6>
                <p>
                    The box model has been around for a long time and is the most widely supported by browsers. You'll
                    experience the fewest rendering inconsistencies using the box model.
                </p>

                <h6> Disadvantages</h6>
                <p>
                    While the box model is fairly easy to understand, it relies on a janky combination of floats and
                    clears
                    to make things work. If you want to achieve a truly responsive design, you'll have to supplement
                    your
                    layout with more media queries using the box model.
                </p>

                <h6>CSS Flexbox</h6>
                <p>
                    Flexbox is a more recently released layout feature that emphasizes responsive design. Using flexbox,
                    you
                    can specify how elements should grow/shrink to fit different screen sizes. Parent flex container
                    divs
                    contain flex items in either a vertical or horizontal direction.
                </p>

                <h6>Advantages</h6>
                <p>
                    Flexbox provides a simpler syntax for controlling layout. You don't have to rely on a janky
                    combination
                    of floats and clears or media queries to make things responsive. By specifying a flex direction,
                    flexbox
                    makes it easy to render components like navigation menus and side bars.
                </p>

                <h6>Disadvantages</h6>
                <p>
                    While flexbox is supported by most major browsers, it's still newer than the traditional box model.
                    This
                    means older browsers don't support it as well (some not at all). There are also more inconsistencies
                    across different browsers. Flexbox also gets complicated with more complex layouts and is limited to
                    only one direction (horizontal or vertical).

                <p>= is used for assigning values to a variable, == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores

                    = is called as assignment operator, == is called as comparison operator whereas It is also called as

                code into the try…catch block. If an error is present, the catch block will execute, else only the try
                block statements will get executed.</p>

                <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents
                    the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
                    the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

                <p>
                    A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML
                    source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that
                    same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web
                    page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
